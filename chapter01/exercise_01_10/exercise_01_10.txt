Watch attributes are time, color, band, style. The behaviors of the watch include setting the time
and getting the time. The user of the watch
does not need to know the mechanics of the watch in order to use it; the user only needs to know that the watch keeps the
proper time. The interface to the watch allows the user to set and get the time.
